Lacs supports all of the basic features of Scala, such as functions, arithmetic, loops and conditionals, as well as some more advanced features, including closures and nested functions.</p> <p> The compiler itself is written in Scala. A Lacs program is passed in as a string, which is tokenized and parsed. After this, context-sensitive analysis (e.g. type checking, name resolution) is performed, and the parse tree is traversed and translated into MIPS machine code.</p>"

To measure these variables, UWAQ's aquaponics system was connected to several sensors that relayed their data to an Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller then sent these measurements through a serial connection to a computer, which uploaded them to a server for storage and analysis.</p> <p>My role in the project was to construct a PHP and MySQL backend to store the measurements. Additionally, I implemented measurement analysis scripts which would notify team members when any measurements were out of their desired range, and a web UI to help visualize measurement data.</p>"
